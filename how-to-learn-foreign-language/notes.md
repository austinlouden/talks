INTRO

Hey, I'm Austin, I'm an iOS engineer on the Core Experience team.
Today, I'd like to tell you about one of my favorite things to do,
learing languages.

===

MY BACKGROUND

So I grew up speaking only English, and my parents speak only English
as well - and that's kind of who this talk is for:
- maybe you grew up speaking only English as well
- maybe you grew up speaking English along with another language your
parents spoke, and you're interested in learning something entirely
different

Took Latin for 4 years in high school and I was terrible at it.
Then I wanted to take Spanish in college, but the only open classes
were at 8am, so instead I took Italian, didn't go so well either.

Despite that, I was still really interested in this idea of speaking
another langauge, just because it seemed liked such a novel
experience.

So I started studying Spanish. Later, I ended up living
in Barcelona for a month which helped immensely.

I lived with people who only spoke Spanish, so I got to the point
where I was having conversations every day.

Then after I was okay at Spanish, I thought, wouldn't it be cool to
try to get to the same level that I'm at in Spanish in some other languages?

To have a process, then refine that process over time.

So I learned a bit of German for a while, and I'm currently studying French.
And now I'm kinda shooting for the point where I can have not just casual
conversation, but more complex converstations.

A PROCESS

So that's what this talk is about - a process.

- that I've learned from my experiences learning parts of these 
languages
- that I've learned from reading books and kind of distilling lots of
information that I've learned from language learners more experienced
than myself?

How do you get from knowing nothing about
a language, to being able to have simple conversations in that language,
then how do you get from that, to progressively more complex converstations?

===

WHEN I STARTED...

When I started, this was my impression of language learning.
There are all these tools out there.

===

IN THIS TALK

To break down this problem, there are two key questions: 
what tools should I use?
How to I go from using those tools to having conversations? 

===


Before I go into the details of the tools and the process,
it's helpful to have an understanding of some ideas that language
learning community is gravitating towards.

These ideas form the basis for the process
