### Overview

1. Theory
2. Tools

!!!

### My background

| Language | Time | Ability |
| -------- | ------ | ----- |
| Latin | 4 years | Terrible |
| Italian | 1 years | Terrible |
| Spanish | 6 months | Pretty good |
| German | 3 months | Meh |
| French | 3 months | OK |

Note: I don't know if Latin has helped. Get to college, placed into Spanish 2, but I didn't take it bc 8am.

!!!

### Learning a language isn't hard — it's just long

Note: The hardest part is at the beginning.

!!!

### Learn pronunciation first

Note: people shy away bc they're worried about how they sound

!!!

### We don't use that many words

Note: Randall Munroe of xkcd, up goer five = Saturn V Rocket

### Coverage

| Words | Coverage |
| -------- | ------ |
| 1000 | 80% of text |
| 2000 | 85% of text |
| 3000 | 89% of text |

Note: this comes from a fascinating read about how Routledge makes their frequency dictionaries (with 100 mil words as input) https://www.scribd.com/doc/35527699/Spanish-Word-Frequency-Study ALSO these numbers are usually higher coverage for spoken because speech tends to be much more repetitive. Things are broken down by ranges and compared, e.g. fiction text vs. scientific textbooks, etc.

!!!

### In general

| Words | Rule of thumb |
| -------- | ------ |
| 250 | the core of a language |
| 750 | used every day by people who speak the language |
| 2500 | everything you could possibly want to say, albeit awkwardly |
| 5000 | native speakers without higher education |
| 10000 | native speakers with higher education | 
| 20000 | passively read, understand, and enjoy a work of literature such as a novel by a notable author |

Note: Spanish, 4k words = 90%. linguists use the term lexeme. Alexander Argüelles prof at American University. After learning several languages

!!!

### Good news

```
10 words a day * 365 days = 3,650 words
```

Note: puts you somewhere between everything you could want to say and a native speaker without higher education

!!!

### Tools

!!!

### 4 Elements of learning a language

- Speaking
- Listening
- Reading
- Writing

Note: Different tools are designed for different things. Don't expect one tool to take you from zero to proficiency.

!!!

### Speaking

Look for things that require you to _produce_ the language.

- Michel Thomas
- Pimsleur 

Note: THE thing you want to focus on

!!!

### Recap:
- Consistency is key — learning is long, not hard
- Focus on the common words
- Learn pronunciation first
- Pick the right tools for the job
