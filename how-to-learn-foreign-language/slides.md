### A process

What tools should I use?
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" --> 
How do I go from using those tools to having conversations?
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

!!!

### When I started...

1. Duolingo, Rosetta Stone, etc.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
2. ???
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
3. Fluency
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->

Note: assuming you can't live in a foreign country,
or don't have any relatives that can help you

!!!

### My background

| Language | Time | Ability |
| -------- | ------ | ----- |
| Latin | 4 years | Terrible |
| Italian | 1 year | Terrible |
| Spanish | 6 months | OK (B1/B2) |
| German | 4 months | Meh (A2) |
| French | 3 months | OK (A2) |

Note: I don't know if Latin has helped. Get to college, placed into Spanish 2, but I didn't take it bc 8am.

!!!


### Part One: Foundations

!!!

### 1. Learning a language isn't hard — it's just long

![language mountain](img/language_mountain.png)

Note: The hardest part is at the beginning.

!!!

### 2. Learn the sounds and pronunciation first

Note: If there's one thing that I've seen recent consensus about,
in language learning books, blogs, etc. — it's that learning
pronunciation is perhaps the most important. It's funny, because in
school, this is probably the area where we place the least effort.
I think more for reasons on scale and not for reasons of value.
Easy to give exams about vocab. Easy to fill in the blank in Duolingo.

!!!

### Two approaches to learning

- Reading and Writing
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- Speaking and Listening
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

Note: At a higher level, there are two approaches to language learning.
Most people, because it's the most convenient, or most
available, learn the skillset of reading and writing

!!!

### Common pitfalls of learning by reading and writing

- I know a lot of vocab, but native speakers speak too quickly for
me to understand
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- I can write well, but I can't speak
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- Native speakers can't understand my accent
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->

Note: 
When you look at the problems people often say they have
when learning a language, the community has noticed that many
of these can be traced back to an education that based mostly on
reading and writing.
- if you don't know a word by how it sounds, you will never
be fast enough to take the words you're hearing, imagine them in text
form, and then map that to a translation in your brain. You need to go
straight from sounds to meaning.
- a lot of this comes from fear of mispronouncing things
- this can come from reading a lot before you understand how to pronounce
things. You voice the words in you're head and internalize wrong
pronunciations. You're not learning French, you're learning a third
language, that's somewhere between English and French, that only you
know.

!!!


### 3. Focus on the most frequently used words

Note: As part of Thing Explainer, Randall Munroe of xkcd, up goer five = Saturn V Rocket

!!!

### Coverage

| Words | Coverage |
| -------- | ------ |
| 1000 | 80% of text |
| 2000 | 85% of text |
| 3000 | 89% of text |

Note: this comes from a fascinating read about how Routledge makes their frequency dictionaries (with 100 mil words as input) https://www.scribd.com/doc/35527699/Spanish-Word-Frequency-Study ALSO these numbers are usually higher coverage for spoken because speech tends to be much more repetitive. Things are broken down by ranges and compared, e.g. fiction text vs. scientific textbooks, etc.

!!!

### In general

| Words | Rule of thumb |
| -------- | ------ |
| 250 | the core of a language |
| 750 | used every day by people who speak the language |
| 2500 | everything you could possibly want to say, albeit awkwardly |
| 5000 | native speakers without higher education |
| 10000 | native speakers with higher education | 
| 20000 | passively read, understand, and enjoy a work of literature such as a novel by a notable author |

Note: Spanish, 4k words = 90%. linguists use the term lexeme. Alexander Argüelles prof at American University. After learning several languages

!!!

### Good news

```
10 words a day * 365 days = 3,650 words
```

Note: puts you somewhere between everything you could want to say 
and a native speaker without higher education.
But of course, there's more to langauge than vocab.

!!!

### Part Two: Tools

Note: second part of the talk, tools or tactics. So, if you agree
with the foundations in the first part, how do you put those into practice?

1. learning a language isn't hard, it's long
2. start with sounds and pronunciation
3. learn the most common words first

!!!

### 4 Elements

- Speaking
- Listening
- Reading
- Writing

Note: Different tools are designed for different things. Don't expect one tool to take you from zero to proficiency.

!!!

### Spaced-Repetition Software (SRS)

Note: the scene where neo is in the chair, then wakes up and says I KNOW KUNG FU
SRS can be good for all four elements, and I can show you what I mean
by that later.

!!!

### SRS Recommendations

- Anki (https://apps.ankiweb.net/)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- Memrise (https://www.memrise.com/)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

Note: two recommendations, both are free.
- Anki is the definitive app for serious language-learners. Download
decks or make your own.
- Memrise has a really polished mobile app and courses made by
professionals. All their cards have audio (and most other deck have
audio as well)

!!!

### How to Make Good Flashcards

- No English! Use images instead
- 3 cards for every word

Note: the other huge benefit to Anki is that you can generate many different
flashcards with the same data.
Spot the differences, Fluent Forever

!!!

### Flash card data

- French word
- image
- IPA
- gender and part of speech
- audio

| Front | Back | 
| -------- | 
| French word | image, audio... | 
| Image | French word, audio... | 
| Audio | French word, image... | 


!!!

### Speaking

Look for things that require you to _produce_ the language.

- Michel Thomas
- Pimsleur 
- iTalki

Note: THE thing you want to focus on

!!!


### Listening

- Pimsleur
- Easy languages (YouTube)
- Minimal pairs
- iTalki

!!!

### Writing

- journal
- Lang-8 (http://lang-8.com/)

!!!


### Reading

- read a book you've already read before (childhood favorites)


!!!

### Summary

!!!

### There's a more detailed method to language learning

1. Learn pronunciation
2. Learn about 700 words with SRS
3. Learn some basic grammar
4. Learn to say or write simple things
5. Have simple conversations with a native speakers
6. Continue speaking, listening, learning vocabulary and grammar 
7. Fluency?

!!!

### Good things to remember

- Consistency is key — learning is long, not hard
- Focus on the common words
- Learn pronunciation first
- Pick the right tools for the job
